        <h2>Become an OFOSA Foster</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-text">
<p>You can provide the critical step for dogs and cats moving from the shelter environment to a permanent loving home. By opening your heart and home to a shelter animal, you prevent needless euthanasia due to a lack of space in shelters. The number of animals we save largely depends on the number of foster homes we have available.

    There is no special training needed. You simply need a desire to care for a dog or cat and the willingness to meet the animals needs by providing:
    
    a safe, healthy, clean environment (with fenced back yard for dogs preferably)
    healthy food (provided if needed and requested)
    medications (provided if prescribed)
    your own home or a landlord that will allow you to foster
    transportation to and from adoption appointments and vet appointments (if applicable)
    other household animals must be spayed / neutered
    medical attention if necessary, to be arranged through our office by our veterinarians
    The overall mission of the OFOSA foster care network is to give animals individualized care and the additional time they need to locate their “forever home.”</p>
