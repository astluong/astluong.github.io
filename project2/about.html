        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-text">
<p>OFOSA has grown from a small kitchen table operation with a handful of passionate animal lovers to become a respected leader in this cause, helping to support several local shelters, rescues and hundreds of foster homes. We transport hundreds of animals every year out of overcrowded high kill shelters from as far away as California. We have skilled and trained medical staff with a fully functioning spay and neuter clinic, providing hundreds of surgeries per year.

    With the help of our dedicated foster families and volunteers, we are proud that we have been able to provide homes for over 98% of our rescued animals.
    
    Every animal that we get at OFOSA is unique in personality and circumstance, however, we follow the same specific processes to provide the best possible outcome for a healthy, happy animal and a successful adoption. Some of our processes are listed below:
    
    Medical Evaluation & Treatment
    Spay or Neuter, without exception
    Microchip
    Vaccinations, Worm & Flea/Tick Treatment
    Grooming when needed, Bath, Nail Trims on all
    Animal Photo & Information uploaded to
    online database
    Placing in Foster Home
    Finding optimum adoption match</p>
